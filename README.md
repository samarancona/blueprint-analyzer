# Blueprint Analyzer Plugin

A comprehensive Unreal Engine 5 editor plugin that performs deep structural analysis of Blueprint assets and converts them into LLM-friendly formats. Goes far beyond simple node/connection extraction — delivers full metadata, execution flow traces, performance anti-pattern diagnostics, project-wide dependency graphs, and UMG optimization scoring. Purpose-built for AI-assisted development, code review, and performance optimization.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Complete Blueprint Analysis
- **Full Metadata Extraction**: Parent class, implemented interfaces, variables (type · default value · Editable/Replicated/ExposeOnSpawn flags · category · tooltip), custom function signatures (parameters, return type, Pure/Const/Static, access specifier), components (full SCS hierarchy for Actor BPs), event dispatchers, macros, timelines
- **Execution Flow Tracing**: DFS from every Event/CustomEvent/FunctionEntry with Branch/Sequence labeling, latent node detection, cycle guards, and tree-indented output LLMs can read at a glance
- **Full Graph Coverage**: Event graphs, function graphs, macro graphs, delegate signature graphs — no hidden logic
- **Literal Value Extraction**: Hardcoded constants on unconnected input pins (e.g. `Print String("Hello")`) surfaced directly
- **Comment Group Detection**: Nodes wrapped by Comment boxes are grouped under their comment title for semantic context

### 🔄 Blueprint → LLM Conversion
- **🔄 .uasset to Text**: Binary Blueprint files converted to readable text
- **📊 Multiple Export Formats**: JSON for programmatic use, human-readable text for LLM analysis
- **⚡ Massive Data Reduction**: 80-90% smaller than raw uasset — visual layout stripped, logic preserved
- **🎯 AI-Optimized Output**: Specifically formatted for ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLMs
- **🪙 Token Estimation**: Predict token consumption before pasting into an LLM
- **🌐 Universal Blueprint Support**: Actor, Component, Widget, Animation, Interface, Level, Function Library, Macro Library

### ⚡ Blueprint Performance Diagnostics
- **Performance Score (0-100)**: Blueprint-level grading mirroring the UMG system
- **Anti-Pattern Detection**:
  - Expensive calls in Tick (`GetAllActorsOfClass`, `LineTrace`, `GetAllActorsWithInterface`, etc.)
  - Cast in Tick (should be cached once)
  - Bloated BeginPlay initialization (>100 downstream nodes)
  - Heavy Tick graph (>50 downstream nodes)
  - Excessive Cast usage (>20 total)
- **Prioritized Recommendations**: Each issue includes rationale, point deduction, and specific fix suggestion

### 🎨 Widget Blueprint Optimization
- **UMG Performance Scoring (0-100)**: Comprehensive optimization grade with justification
- **Hierarchy Analysis**: Detect deep nesting (>5 levels) and layout complexity
- **Smart Optimization Detection**: Identify missing Invalidation Box and Retainer Box
- **Widget Combination Analysis**: Flag problematic ScaleBox + SizeBox combinations
- **Real Binding Detection**: Reads actual `UWidgetBlueprint::Bindings` — no heuristic guessing
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific fix suggestions tied to each detected issue

### 📁 Project-Level Batch Analysis
- **Folder Analysis**: Right-click any Content Browser folder → analyze every Blueprint inside
- **Recursive Folder LLM Exports**: Select one or more folders to export a separate LLM text file for every Blueprint in their subfolders, including Widget and Animation Blueprints, with no duplicate exports for overlapping selections
- **Aggregate Report**: Total nodes, average performance score, top 10 worst offenders sorted by score
- **Dependency Graph**: Extract Spawn / Cast / Call / HardRef references between Blueprints
- **Circular Dependency Detection**: Automated cycle discovery across the project
- **Bulk Token Estimation**: Per-Blueprint LLM token budget upfront

### 🔧 Editor Integration
- **Right-click on any Blueprint**: full per-asset analysis menus
- **Multi-select Blueprints**: export a separate LLM text file for every selected Blueprint
- **Automatic LLM Exports**: save reports under the project's `Saved/LLMAnalisys`, preserving Unreal package folders and overwriting previous reports
- **Right-click on any Content Browser folder**: batch project analysis
- **Non-destructive**: never modifies your Blueprints
- **Editor-only**: no runtime dependencies, no packaged-game overhead

## 🚀 Installation

1. Copy the `BlueprintAnalyzer` folder to your project's `Plugins` directory
2. Regenerate project files (right-click `.uproject` → Generate Visual Studio project files)
3. Build your project
4. Enable the plugin in Editor → Plugins → Developer Tools → Blueprint Analyzer

## 📋 Usage

### Single Blueprint Analysis

#### Quick Analysis
1. Select any Blueprint (.uasset) in the Content Browser
2. Right-click → **Blueprint Analyzer** → **Analyze Blueprint**
3. View complete metadata summary (type, parent, variables, functions, components, execution paths, etc.)

#### Export for AI / Programmatic Use
1. Select a Blueprint → Right-click → **Blueprint Analyzer**
2. Choose **Export to JSON** (programmatic) or **Export to LLM Text** (AI-friendly)
3. LLM text saves automatically; JSON opens a save-file dialog
4. Paste result into ChatGPT / Claude for code review, C++ migration, documentation, bug hunting

All LLM text exports use the project's `Saved/LLMAnalisys` folder, which is created automatically. Reports preserve the logical Unreal package path: `/Game/Characters/BP_Player` exports to `Saved/LLMAnalisys/Game/Characters/BP_Player_LLM_Analysis.txt`. Existing reports are always overwritten, with no folder picker, save-file dialog, or overwrite confirmation. The Blueprint editor's **Analyze LLM** toolbar button uses the same destination.

### Multiple Blueprint LLM Exports
1. Select multiple Blueprints in the Content Browser (Ctrl-click or Shift-click), including Widget and Animation Blueprints if needed
2. Right-click → **Blueprint Analyzer** → **Analyze Selected Blueprints for LLM**
3. Each Blueprint automatically gets its own `<AssetName>_LLM_Analysis.txt` under `Saved/LLMAnalisys`, with the same complete analysis as a single-asset export
4. Unreal package folders are preserved, so assets with the same name in different folders stay separate
5. Review the final counts of exported files, skipped non-Blueprint assets, and any failures

Widget optimization, Blueprint performance, and folder LLM reports also save automatically under `Saved/LLMAnalisys`, preserving their source package folders and distinct report filenames. JSON exports continue to use a save-file dialog.

### Folder Blueprint LLM Exports
1. Select one or more folders in the Content Browser
2. Right-click → **Blueprint Analyzer** → **Analyze Blueprints in Selected Folders for LLM**
3. Every Blueprint in the selected folders and all subfolders gets its own `<AssetName>_LLM_Analysis.txt` under `Saved/LLMAnalisys`, preserving its logical Unreal package path and automatically overwriting existing reports

This includes all Blueprint subclasses, such as Widget and Animation Blueprints. Selecting both a parent folder and its subfolders exports each asset only once. **Analyze Folder** and the aggregate project reports remain available separately.

### Blueprint Performance Audit
1. Right-click any Blueprint → **Performance Analysis** → **Analyze Blueprint Performance**
2. Review the 0-100 score and prioritized anti-pattern issues
3. Export detailed JSON / LLM Text reports for team review

### Widget Blueprint Optimization
1. Right-click a Widget Blueprint → **Widget Optimization** → **Analyze Widget Blueprint**
2. See optimization score, issues, memory estimate, and recommendations
3. Export detailed JSON / LLM Text reports

### Project-Wide Batch Analysis
1. Right-click any **folder** in the Content Browser → **Blueprint Analyzer**
2. Choose **Analyze Folder** for an aggregate summary popup
3. Export JSON or LLM Text for the full dependency graph, top offenders list, and circular-dependency chains
